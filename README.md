# Contra's Toolbox
This is just a collection of scripts on various tools that I use in my various games and on my different computers and stuff like that.

This is basically a half-fork away from my "DOVM-Creation-Scripts" repo, and basically contains all my stuff, and serves as a half-step towards a "wiki" that I can throw at people who need extra info on things.
